                <p>
                    We lost our 24-year-old son, Zane Templin, to suicide in 2016.
                    Zane was an amazing person, son, brother, and a friend to many.  
                    He was a black belt in Tang Soo Do at the age of 13.  
                    Zane was a scholar-athlete graduated with honors from Santa Rosa High.  
                    He went to University of California at Davis and received a degree in neurobiology, physiology, & behavior.  
                    He attended the prestigious Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry in San Francisco.

                    His smile lit up any room that he entered, and he is loved and missed by many.

                <h1>About The Zane Templin Foundation</h1>
                <p><b>
                    The Zane Templin Foundation, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, was formed in Zane's memory. 
                    Our mission is to support mental health awareness and suicide prevention.  
                    Our focus is on the children, teens, and young adults of Sonoma County.  ​
                    ​We believe in funding research, educating the public about mental health and suicide prevention, 
                    and supporting survivors of suicide loss and those affected by suicide.
                    We are also involved in the Out of the Darkness Community Walk held at our local park every year.  
                    Team Zane – “You Matter” has raised over $139,000 for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention since 2016.
                    Every year our sold-out benefit gala, “High Heels For Hope” helps us 
                    fundraise, make a difference, save lives, and bring hope to those affected by suicide.
